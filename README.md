###### Anamoly-Detection-in-Credit-Card-Transactions
This repository provides a comprehensive solution for credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques. Detecting anomalies in credit card transactions is a critical task to ensure the security of financial transactions and protect users from fraudulent activities.

## Overview
Credit card fraud detection involves identifying unusual patterns and outliers in transaction data that may indicate fraudulent behavior. This repository presents a machine learning-based approach to detect anomalies in credit card transactions.

## Getting Started
#Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Dependencies (install using pip install -r requirements.txt)
Installation
#Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection

#Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is available at [link_to_dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). Please download and place it in the data/ directory.

#Usage
Run the credit card fraud detection script:

python credit_card_fraud_detection.py

#This script applies machine learning models to the credit card transaction dataset, identifies anomalies, and reports potential fraud.

#Features
#Preprocessing:

The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including normalization, encoding, and feature scaling, to prepare it for machine learning models.
Machine Learning Models:

#Utilizes various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks for anomaly detection.
Easily switch between models by modifying the model_type variable in the script.
#Evaluation Metrics:

The script provides metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the selected machine learning model.
#Visualization:

Generates visualizations, including confusion matrices and ROC curves, to aid in understanding the model's performance.
#Contributing
